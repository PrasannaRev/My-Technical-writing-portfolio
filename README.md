# My-technical-writing-portfolio
Hi and welcome to my Technical Writing Portfolio! My name is Prasanna Revankar, and I am passionate about making complex topics into user-friendly content.
Experience using DITA, XML based software to create documentation. 
My writing samples includes structured and concept based authoring, an installation guide, and a how-to guide.

I hope my technical writing portfolio gives you an insight into my tech writing skills

Thank you for visiting my portfolio. I look forward to the possibility of working together!
