As part of my technical writing portfolio I have learned and used Oxygen XML Editor, a leading authoring tool for structured content development using DITA (Darwin Information Typing Architecture) standards. 

I familiarized myself with the toolâ€™s interface, including topic creation, map management, validation, and publishing workflows.

To apply my knowledge, I created a sample documentation project using DITA-compliant topics such as concept, task, and reference.
